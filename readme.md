# Giving Execution Permissions to Scripts

Before you can execute a script file, you need to ensure that it has the necessary permissions. Here's how you can give execution permissions to your scripts:

## Using the `chmod` Command

The `chmod` command is used to change the permissions of a file. To give execution permissions to a script, you need to use the `+x` option with `chmod` or `774`.

```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
```

or

```bash
chmod 774 script_name.sh
```

Replace `script_name.sh` with the name of your script file. After running this command, you'll have execution permissions for the script `my_script.sh`.

### Checking Permissions

You can verify the permissions of a file using the `ls` command with the `-l` option. This will list the permissions along with other information about the file. Here's an example:

```bash
ls -l my_script.sh
```

The output will look something like this:

```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 123 Apr 13 12:00 my_script.sh
```

In this example, the permissions `-rwxr-xr-x` indicate that the file is readable, writable, and executable by the owner, and readable and executable by others.

Happy scripting! ðŸš€
